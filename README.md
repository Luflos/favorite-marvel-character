# Marvel Characters Galore

An application that allows users to search for Marvel characters, comics, and creators. They can add their favorites and save them into a profile for others to see. Users also have the ability to learn in depth about their favorite characters and all the comics that they are featured in as well!

## User Stories
More and more Marvel characters are being added to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and not all of them are well known.
* As a user, I want to know more about the origins of my favorite Marvel characters or ones I haven't heard about
* As a user, I want to add characters, comics, or authors that I find interesting to a list so I can reference later
* As a user, I want more details about specific comics, and authors

##  MVP 
- [x] Homepage that allows users to signup / login 
- [x] Have a navbar which leads to a users profile, homepage, favorites, and logout
- [x] User favorites page that displays their favorite characters, creators, and comics
- [x] User able to search for characters by name or creator
- [x] Have detailed pages for characters, comics, and creators
- [x] Clicking on a comic directs to the detailed page about the comics

## Stretch Goals
- [] Have the comics be able to flip front and back
- [] Use another API to display upcoming MCU films

## Code Highlights

```javascript
const options = {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
}

const pubKey = process.env.MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY
const privKey = process.env.MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY
const ts = new Date().getTime()
const reqHash = createHash('md5').update(ts + privKey + pubKey).digest('hex')

router.get('/charresults', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const url = (`http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters?nameStartsWith=${req.query.searchMarvel}&limit=8&ts=${ts}&apikey=${pubKey}&hash=${reqHash}`)
    
    const response = await axios.get(url, options)
    const marvelChar = response.data.data.results
    const badData = response.data.data
    res.render('search/charresults.ejs', {details: marvelChar, badData})
```
    
```javascript
    Creators:
 <% for( let i=0; i < detail.creators.items.length; i++ ) { %>
   <% const url=detail.creators.items[i].resourceURI
      const lastSegment=url.split("/").pop() %>
     <a class = "text-decoration-none" href="/creators/<%= lastSegment%>">
       <%= detail.creators.items[i].name %>
       (<%=detail.creators.items[i].role%>)
       </a> 
       |<% } %>
```

## Reflection

It's crazy to me that just 6 weeks ago I knew almost nothing about coding but here I am now making a web app.
I struggled a lot with this project and although I'm not fully satisfied by how my app looks but I'm still proud of it.
I initially struggled a lot with the models and the various relationships. As I continued to work on the project those things started to click more but I definitely still need to review a lot more as well. 
I wanted to get to some of my stretch goals but I spent so much time just styling small things here and there that I never got to them.
I also couldn't really find a good free APIs to display upcoming Marvel movies/shows. I found one that I potentially wanted to use but they requested I provide my address and I wasn't fully comfortable with that.
I was honestly held back by the limits of the API. A lot of details aren't provided and a lot of images and descriptions are empty.
Overall, even though I struggled a lot I still had fun making this project.
